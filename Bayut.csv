It is roughly equivalent in height to the Empire State Building in New York. It was originally to be named Al Ameera Tower but the English translation, Princess Tower, was chosen instead.   Princess Tower was originally planned to be just 90 stories and the height was purely a means to maximize the profit on a relatively small plot of land. It was only later into the design process that the developers realized a potential word record was within reach, so the tower was re-designed at the last minute to allow for a further 11 floors.  The tower is positioned slightly closer to the sea than its direct neighbors. That was done to maximize the sea views for the side apartments and explains why it appears off-center on its podium.  AX CAPITAL was built upon a desire to create a real estate agency of the modern era where the customer is central to everything we do. With our values clearly defined, we are committed to continuously evolving as a real estate agency and it is this passion and dedication that marks the foundation of AX CAPITAL and makes us different.
